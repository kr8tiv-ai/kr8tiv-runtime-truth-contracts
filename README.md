**Runtime Truth Contracts** are the verified state layer for the KIN multi-agent ecosystem. Every agent action -- chat inference, credential access, soul mutation, media generation, NFT mint -- flows through a typed contract that enforces schema correctness, audit trails, and governance rules at runtime.

This is not a smart contract repo. It is the **source of truth** for what KIN agents are allowed to do, what state they hold, and how they prove it.

## Cipher — Current Status

> **The Code Kraken is alive.** First of 6 companions shipped through Stage 1 (SFT) and Stage 2 (SimPO anti-slop).

### Models on HuggingFace (public)
| Stage | Model | Format |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Stage 1 SFT | [`Auroraventures/cipher-sft-merged`](https://huggingface.co/Auroraventures/cipher-sft-merged) | safetensors (62.5 GB) |
| Stage 1 SFT GGUF Q4_K_M | [`Auroraventures/cipher-sft-merged-Q4_K_M-GGUF`](https://huggingface.co/Auroraventures/cipher-sft-merged-Q4_K_M-GGUF) | GGUF (18.7 GB, Ollama-ready) |
| Stage 2 SimPO | [`Auroraventures/cipher-simpo-merged`](https://huggingface.co/Auroraventures/cipher-simpo-merged) | safetensors (62.6 GB) |

### Runtime integration (this repo)
The `companions/cipher/` directory + `inference/` module are wired for:
- **Local inference** — Ollama pulls the GGUF, serves via `runtime/inference.ts` (Gemma 4 raw chat template, not Ollama auto-template)
- **Two-brain routing** — `inference/supervisor.ts` escalates vision/video/image tasks to frontier models
- **Render-loop critique** — `companions/cipher/runtime/render-loop.ts` renders generated HTML in Playwright + axe-core audit → screenshot → critique → iterate (designed, pending Stage 3 wiring)
- **Pull from HF**:
  ```bash
  ollama pull hf.co/Auroraventures/cipher-sft-merged-Q4_K_M-GGUF
  ollama cp hf.co/Auroraventures/cipher-sft-merged-Q4_K_M-GGUF kin-cipher
  ```

### Training pipeline status
| Stage | Status | Artifact |

## What "Runtime Truth" Means

A runtime truth contract is a TypeScript module that:

1. **Defines the schema** for a piece of agent state (soul config, credential, conversation, approval)
2. **Validates mutations** before they reach the database
3. **Logs every state change** for auditability
4. **Enforces governance rules** (rate limits, approval gates, trust ladders, drift detection)

The contracts are the single authority that KIN agents reference when deciding what actions are permitted. No agent bypasses the contract layer.

## Key Systems

### Circuit Breaker (Inference Resilience)

Every AI provider runs behind a circuit breaker with three states:

```
CLOSED ----[N failures]----> OPEN ----[cooldown]----> HALF_OPEN
  ^                                                      |
  +----------[probe succeeds]-----------------------------+
```

Failed providers are automatically skipped. After a cooldown period, a single probe request is allowed. If it succeeds, the circuit closes. If it fails, the circuit reopens.

### Watchdog (Service Recovery)

Bot processes (Telegram, Discord, WhatsApp) are monitored by a watchdog state machine:

```
HEALTHY --[5 min idle]--> DEGRADED --[restart]--> RECOVERING
                                                      |
                          FAILED <--[3 failures]------+
                             |
                     [admin alert via Slack/Telegram]
```

### Two-Brain Inference

Every conversation runs through a dual-model architecture:
1. **Primary Brain** -- Fast, cost-efficient model (Groq free tier or local Ollama)
2. **Supervisor Brain** -- Frontier model activates for complex queries via keyword escalation
3. **Privacy Gate** -- PII redacted before any cloud call; local mode keeps everything on-device

### Skill Router

Skills are loaded from builtins and the database, compiled into RegExp trigger patterns, and matched against incoming messages. The router supports registration, unregistration, database-loaded custom skills, and multi-match disambiguation.

### Security Sandbox

Agent-executed commands run in a sandboxed environment with:
- Timeout enforcement (default 30s)
- Output size limits (default 1MB)
- Blocked command list
- Working directory restriction
- Concurrency caps

### Internationalization (i18n)

11 languages supported via `next-intl` with cookie-based locale detection:
`en` `es` `fr` `de` `pt` `ja` `ko` `zh` `it` `ar` `hi`

Companion prompts are language-aware — the system prompt adapts to the user's locale. Translation files live in `web/src/messages/`.

### Canvas Studio

### Proactive Companion

Companions can initiate contact based on context:
- Toggle on/off per companion
- Quiet hours configuration
- Max daily message limits
- Calendar OAuth integration for contextual triggers

### PWA + Desktop

- **PWA**: Service worker with Serwist precaching, offline support, install prompt
- **Desktop**: Tauri v2 with system tray toggle, frameless window, native feel

### Fetch Resilience

All 22 raw `fetch()` calls wrapped with retry logic, timeout enforcement, and structured error handling across 14 production files.

### Zero-Knowledge Memory Encryption

All companion memories are encrypted client-side before touching the API. The server never sees plaintext memory content.

- **AES-256-GCM** symmetric encryption with per-memory initialization vectors
- **PBKDF2** key derivation (100K iterations, SHA-512) from user passphrase
- Encrypted payloads stored as opaque blobs -- decryption happens exclusively in the client
- Key rotation support with re-encryption migration path
- Zero-knowledge architecture: API compromise cannot leak memory contents

### Dream Mode

Companions autonomously initiate conversations during user idle periods, simulating ambient awareness and emotional continuity.

- Activity detection via heartbeat tracking -- idle threshold triggers dream state
- Ambient awareness pulls recent memories, calendar context, and time-of-day signals
- Dream message generation uses personality-weighted prompts with reduced temperature
- Quiet hours and per-companion toggle enforcement
- Dream logs persisted for continuity across sessions

### Predictive Companion Engine

The companion learns behavioral patterns over time and pre-fetches data before the user asks.

- Behavioral pattern extraction from conversation history and interaction timing
- Prediction model generates ranked next-action candidates with confidence scores
- Pre-fetch pipeline hydrates context (weather, calendar, portfolio, news) based on predictions above threshold
- Confidence scoring with exponential decay for stale patterns
- User feedback loop refines prediction accuracy per companion

### Gmail & Calendar OAuth2 Integration

Full OAuth2 lifecycle for Google services with encrypted token storage and proactive companion triggers.

- OAuth2 authorization code flow with PKCE for Gmail and Calendar scopes
- **AES-256-GCM** token encryption at rest -- refresh tokens never stored in plaintext
- Gmail API wrappers: inbox search, thread reading, draft creation, label management
- Calendar event fetching with time-range queries and recurrence expansion
- Proactive triggers: upcoming meetings surface briefing context, email digests during idle windows
- Token refresh handled transparently with circuit breaker on auth failures

### Browser Automation

Headless Puppeteer integration for structured web content extraction with security-first URL validation.

- **SSRF-safe URL validation** -- private IP ranges, localhost, and internal hostnames blocked before navigation
- Concurrent page pooling with configurable max-pages limit to bound resource usage
- Structured content extraction: title, meta, headings, body text, Open Graph, JSON-LD
- Screenshot capture for visual context injection into companion conversations
- Request interception for ad/tracker blocking and bandwidth optimization
- Timeout enforcement per page with graceful cleanup on failure

### Scheduler & Pipeline System

Persistent job scheduling and multi-step workflow orchestration with cron-based triggers.

- **Croner-based scheduler** with persistent job definitions in SQLite
- Full CRUD for scheduled jobs via API routes (`POST /scheduler`, `PATCH /scheduler/:id`, `DELETE /scheduler/:id`)
- Boot-time hydration: all active jobs reloaded and re-registered on server restart
- **Multi-step pipelines** with sequential stage execution and context threading between steps
- Pipeline stages can invoke inference, skills, browser automation, or external APIs
- Cron-triggered pipelines for recurring workflows (daily digest, weekly report, portfolio rebalance)
- Execution history with per-run logs, duration tracking, and failure retry policies

### Knowledge Distillation Pipeline

- Star ratings and written reviews with abuse detection
- Activity feed showing trending companions, new uploads, and community highlights
- Leaderboards ranked by downloads, ratings, and active usage
- One-click companion import with soul config merge and conflict resolution

### Approval Gates

User confirmation gates for external skill mutations with fine-grained policy controls.

- Mutations to external services (email send, calendar create, transaction sign) require explicit user approval
- **Policy engine** with per-skill, per-channel, and per-severity rules
- Auto-approve policies for trusted skill + context combinations below risk threshold
- Approval timeout with configurable expiry and fallback behavior
- Audit log of all approval decisions for governance review

### Soul Drift Detection

Continuous monitoring of companion personality evolution with warm/cold phrase markers.

- Personality trait vector computed from recent conversations and compared against baseline soul config
- **Warm markers** -- phrases and behaviors indicating positive trait alignment
- **Cold markers** -- phrases indicating personality deviation or regression
- Drift score quantified as cosine distance from baseline with configurable alert thresholds
- Drift alerts surfaced in Mission Control with trait-level breakdown
- Auto-correction suggestions generated when drift exceeds tolerance

### Child Safety System

Age-bracket safety prompt injection ensuring COPPA compliance and age-appropriate interactions.

- **Three safety tiers**: `under_13` (COPPA-safe), `teen` (13-17), `adult` (18+)
- System prompt injection layer applies age-bracket guardrails before every inference call
- `under_13` mode: no data collection, no external API calls, content filtering enforced
- `teen` mode: reduced content scope, parental notification hooks, limited skill access
- Content classification gate rejects unsafe outputs before delivery
- Family group integration ensures child accounts inherit parent-configured safety policies

### Multi-Channel Delivery

Unified delivery registry with channel-specific message routing and format adaptation.

- **Delivery registry** supporting Telegram, WhatsApp, Discord, and raw API channels
- Channel-specific message formatting: Markdown (Telegram), rich embeds (Discord), plain text (WhatsApp)
- Per-user channel preference with fallback chain (primary > secondary > API inbox)
- Delivery receipts and retry logic with exponential backoff per channel
- Rate limiting applied per-channel to respect platform-specific API quotas
- Broadcast support for system-wide announcements across all registered channels

### DM Security

Allowlist and pairing code management for secure direct message channels.

- **Allowlist model** -- only pre-approved user IDs can interact with companions via DM
- Pairing codes: time-limited, single-use codes for linking new channels to user accounts
- Channel-specific approval: a user can be approved for Telegram but not Discord
- Pairing flow: generate code in dashboard > enter code in DM > channel linked to account
- Revocation support with immediate channel disconnection
- Audit trail of all pairing and revocation events
